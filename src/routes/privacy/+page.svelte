    <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl my-2">Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      This service is provided by PaulPlay at no cost and is intended for use as is. This page is used to inform
      visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided
      to use our Service. If you choose to use this Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in
      relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service.
      We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">What data we collect</h2>
    <p>
      Our partners (e.g. Google or Stripe) collect details of which version of web browser you used and information on
      how you use the site using page tagging techniques. If you provide your consent, we use Google Analytics and our
      own cookies to collect information about how you use AutoGuessr. For a better experience, while using our Service,
      we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information such as a username. If you
      create an account we will also store account-specific information such as your level or experience. By creating an
      account you accept that we may share non-sensitive information (like your username, email address, experience or
      other associated data) with other users.
      <br /> <br />
      Google Analytics processes information about:
      <br />
      - the pages you visit on AutoGuessr
      <br />
      - how long you spend on each page
      <br />
      - how you got to the site
      <br />
      - what you click on while you're visiting the site
      <br /> <br />
      We make sure you cannot be directly identified by Google Analytics data. We do this by using Google Analytics' IP address
      anonymisation feature. We will not combine analytics information with other data sets in a way that would directly
      identify who you are.
      <br /><br />
      If you register an account on our website, we will collect your username, IP address (to keep multiplayer secure and
      prevent cheaters) and email address that you have provided as well as other account related details that you provide
      at your own choice. Additionally, we save game-related information such as, but not limited to, your account level.
      <br /><br />
      If you purchase any item in the game/on the site, the data you provide might be stored and processed using stripe.
      Please refer to stripe's
      <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" class="underline">privacy policy</a> for more information.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">How we use your data</h2>
    <p>
      The data we collect using Google Analytics is transferred and stored with Google where we analyse it with Google
      Analytics software (Google Analytics 4). We also use your data, such as your username, in our multiplayer
      experiences and may share that with other players.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">Why we collect data</h2>
    <p>
      We use the information we collect through the explained means to see how you use AutoGuessr and to see how well
      the site performs on your device. We also strive to improve our website by analysing issues. Furthermore, we use
      your data to enrich multiplayer functionalities.
    </p>
    <br /> <br />
    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">How long we keep your data</h2>
    <p>
      We will only retain your personal data for as long as it is needed for the purposes set out in this document or
      for as long as the law requires us to.
    </p>
    <br /><br />
    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">How we keep your data secure</h2>
    <p>
      We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We set up systems and processes to prevent
      unauthorised access to or disclosure of the data we collect about you. For example, we protect your data using
      varying levels of encryption. All third parties that process personal data for AutoGuessr are required to keep
      that data secure. We also only store a hash of your password if you sign up.
    </p>
    <br /><br />
    <h2 class="font-bold text-xl">Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may change this privacy notice. When we make changes to this notice, the 'last updated' date below will also
      change. Any changes to this privacy notice will apply to you and your data immediately. If these changes affect
      how your personal data is processed, AutoGuessr will take reasonable steps to make sure you know.
